## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install Audiobook Py, first clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DestinEcarma/audiobook-py.git
cd audiobook-py
```

The project uses `rye` for package management, I highly recommend using it for installing the dependencies.

```sh
rye sync
```

If you don't have `rye` installed, you can install the dependencies manually. The required dependencies are:

```sh
keyboard pyttsx3 rich rich-argparse
```

### Optional

Install the package as a binary executable using `pyinstaller`:

```sh
rye run install
```

This will generate a standalone binary in the dist/ directory. To make the binary executable available globally, you can move it to a directory in your system's `PATH`.

**Linux/macOS:**

```sh
sudo mv dist/audiobook-py /usr/bin/
```

**Windows:**

- Move the `dist/audiobook-py.exe` file to a directory of your choice (e.g. `C:\tools\`).
- Add the directory to your **System Environment Variables $\to$ PATH**.
